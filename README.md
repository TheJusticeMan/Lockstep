# Lockstep

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

Lockstep restricts note editing while waiting on the status of Obsidian sync in order to prevent merge conflicts. This process disables after three consecutive "Fully synced" statuses (checks happen once every second) but can also be disabled manually via the button.
